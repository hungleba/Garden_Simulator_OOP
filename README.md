# Garden_Simulator_OOP
A Java garden simulator program interface

This program stimulates a garden. The gardeners can perform many actions
on their garden such as: plant, grow, pick(flower), cut(tree),
harvest(vegetable), and print the garden out as 2d array. Besides,
the users can choose details on their action like which plot to perform
action, how many time that performance should be repeated, which seed or
seedtype users want to remove from the garden.

This is a classic object-oriented-programming problem, therefore, the "Plant"
class has-a "Flower", "Tree", or "Vegetable" class. It also has the is-a 
relationship with "Garden" class to make sure the inheritance feature in
OOP can be fully utilized.
